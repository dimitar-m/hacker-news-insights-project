Data Science Project - Maximizing Engagement: Insights on Hacker News Post Timing and Topic Impact

I’m excited to share my latest data analysis project, which delves into the engagement patterns of posts on Hacker News. Using a dataset of 20,100 submissions, I’ve explored several aspects to uncover insights that can help users optimize their posts for maximum visibility and interaction.

Key Questions Addressed:

Do “Ask HN” or “Show HN” posts receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at certain times receive more comments or points on average?
How do other types of posts compare in terms of engagement?

Dataset Overview:

Total Rows: 20,100
Columns:
id: Unique identifier for each post
title: Title of the post
url: URL the post links to (if applicable)
num_points: Total points the post acquired (upvotes minus downvotes)
num_comments: Number of comments on the post
author: Username of the person who submitted the post
created_at: Date and time of the post’s submission
Summary of Findings:

“Ask HN” posts generally receive more comments compared to “Show HN” posts, especially when posted in the afternoon.
“Show HN” posts tend to garner more points, particularly when posted late at night or around noon.
Other posts outperform both “Ask HN” and “Show HN” posts in terms of both comments and points, with the best times being around midday.
I’ve broken down the data to identify the best times for posting to maximize engagement, providing actionable insights for anyone looking to improve their Hacker News submissions.
